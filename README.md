# Web-development
This repository contains all of my personal web development projects. They're all written from scratch except some boilerplate code.


### Project 1 : Personal CV Website using HTML5 and CSS
    This website was first structured using HTML5 then CSS was added to it.
    This website was created in about 3-4 days.
    
   Webpage link : [Visit the Website.](https://debaksen.github.io/Web-development/)
   
    PS : This webpage was created only for computers and the alignment of images/text may change if it's accessed via other devices.
