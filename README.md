# Web-development
This repository contains all of my personal web development projects. They're all written from scratch except some boilerplate code.

### Project 1 : Personal CV Website using HTML5 and CSS
    This website was first structured using HTML5 then CSS was added to it.
    This website was created in about 3-4 days.
    
    The website is live at : [GitHub Pages](https://debaksen.github.io/Web-development/).
